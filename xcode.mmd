# XCode

Go to the Apple app store: install Xcode.

To set it up, click the Launchpad dock icon (the silver rocket ship), then choose Xcode. It will install some pieces.

Xcode menu > Preferences menu item > Downloads icon > Components tab

Install these:

  * Command Line Tools
  * Everything else (this seems to help the brew package manager path)
