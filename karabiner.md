# Karabiner

Karabiner is a macOS utility to change keyboard typing. 

We use it to change the behavior of the keyboard "caps lock" key to make it more user-friendly for our programming. We make a key stroke types "escape", and a key press types "escape".

Steps:

1. System Preferences &rarr; Keyboard &rarr; Modifier Keys &rarr Caps Lock Key &rarr; ^ Control

1. Install Karabiner: `brew cask install karabiner`

1. Launch Karabiner

1. Search for: Control_L to Control_L

1. Check the box: Control_L to Control_L &rarr; (+ When you type Control_L only, send Escape
