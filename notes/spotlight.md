# Spotlight

The Spotlight search index tends to be slow, and also to use up power, so we choose to optimize Spotlight by skipping a bunch of folders.

Skip the Spotlight search index on these folders:

    /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/Resources/
    /usr/local/var/postgres/pg_stat_tmp/
    ~/Library/Application Support/Adium/
    ~/Library/Application Support/Adium 2.0/
    ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/
    ~/Library/Application Support/Google/
    ~/Library/Application Support/iCloud/
    ~/Library/Application Support/iCloud/
    ~/Library/Application Support/LastPass/
    ~/Library/Application Support/OpenOffice/
    ~/Library/Application Support/Skype/
    ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/
    ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/
    ~/Library/Application Support/TeamViewer/
    ~/Library/Application Support/Transmission/
    ~/Library/Application Support/Ubiquity/
    ~/Library/Google/GoogleSoftwareUpdate/
