## PSA: Beware of sudo on OS X
##
## There's a a newly discovered local root
## exploit on OS X 10.10.5, so I thought this might be a good time to
## make sure everyone is aware of something that I just discovered
## myself a few days ago: Apple ships sudo with tty_tickets disabled
## by default. What this means is that if you use sudo to give
## yourself root privileges, your sudo authentication is not bound to
## the TTY in which you ran sudo. It applies to any process you (or
## malware running as you) start after authentication. The way Apple
## ships sudo it is, essentially, a giant privilege escalation
## vulnerability. To see this: open two terminal windows and run sudo
## in both of them. Only the first one will ask for your password.
##
## It's easy to fix.  Just run visudo and add this line:
##
##     Defaults tty_tickets
##
Defaults    tty_tickets
