# XCode

Get it:

1. Launch Apple app store.
2. Install Xcode.

Setup:

1. Click the Launchpad dock icon (the silver rocket ship)
2. Choose Xcode. It will install some pieces.


## Setup

Start:

  * Xcode menu > Preferences menu item 
  
### Accounts icon

  * Tap the "Accounts" icon.
  * 2. Add your Apple id.


### Downloads icon 

Components tab > install the current versions of these, plus whatever else we want:

  * Command Line Tools
  * iOS *.* Simulator (whatever is the current version)
  * Everything else (because these seems to help the brew package manager path)
  
Documents tab > install the current versions of these, plus whatever else we want:

  * Xcode *.* doc set
  * OS X *.* Doc set
  * iOS *.* Doc set
  * Mac OS X *.* Core Library

N.b. Installing all these should solve this Xcode Brew error message:

    Experimental support for using Xcode with the "Command Line Tools".
