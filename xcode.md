# XCode

Go to the Apple app store: install Xcode.

To set it up, click the Launchpad dock icon (the silver rocket ship), then choose Xcode. It will install some pieces.


## Command Line Tools

Start:

  * Xcode menu > Preferences menu item > Downloads icon > Components tab


Install these:

  * Command Line Tools
  * Everything else (this seems to help the brew package manager path)


This should solve this Xcode Brew error message:

    Experimental support for using Xcode with the "Command Line Tools".
